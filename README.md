# iXBRL sample documents

This repository contains a number of Inline XBRL (or
[iXBRL](https://www.xbrl.org/ixbrl)) sample documents created by [XBRL
International](https://www.xbrl.org).

These samples were created to demonstrate that the requirement to use XHTML in
iXBRL documents imposes no practical constraints on the design and styling of
the documents.

The samples also demonstrate some of the practical benefits and features of
using HTML+CSS rather than PDF for financial reports, including the ability to
make the reports mobile-friendly through the use of responsive CSS, and the
ability to target print media in order to create high quality, printable
documents (and PDFs).

As well as including the final iXBRL documents, this repository includes
documentation on how these samples were prepared, and the source from which
they were generated (see [iXBRL creation](#ixbrl-creation))

## Samples

The repository includes the following samples:

* [GLEIF Annual Report 2017](https://github.com/XBRLInternational/ixbrl-samples/tree/master/ixbrl/gleif-annual-report-2017)
* [XBRL International Financial Statements 2018](https://github.com/XBRLInternational/ixbrl-samples/tree/master/ixbrl/xii-financial-statements-2018)

## Source

The samples are created using a simple templating system, and CSS files prepared using the less CSS
preprocessor.  The source from which these files are built can be found the 
[src directory](https://github.com/XBRLInternational/ixbrl-samples/tree/master/src)
