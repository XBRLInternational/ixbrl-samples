# iXBRL sample documents

**This repository has moved to https://gitlab.xbrl.org/xii/ixbrl-samples**

This repository contains a number of Inline XBRL (or
[iXBRL](https://www.xbrl.org/ixbrl)) sample documents created by [XBRL
International](https://www.xbrl.org).

These samples were created to demonstrate that the requirement to use XHTML in
iXBRL documents imposes no practical constraints on the design and styling of
the documents.

The samples also demonstrate some of the practical benefits and features of
using HTML+CSS rather than PDF for financial reports, including the ability to
make the reports mobile-friendly through the use of responsive CSS, and the
ability to target print media in order to create high quality, printable
documents (and PDFs).

As well as including the final iXBRL documents, this repository includes
documentation on how these samples were prepared, and the source from which
they were generated (see [iXBRL creation](#ixbrl-creation))
