                <h1>GLEIF enables people and businesses to
make smarter, less costly and more reliable
decisions about who to do business with.</h1>
<p>
We do this by facilitating the implementation of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) and by
making available the Global LEI Index. The Global LEI Index is a central portal that captures
entity data and ownership data. It is the only global online source that provides
open, standardized and high-quality legal entity reference data which can be accessed
free of charge by any user.
</p>
<p>
We deliver trusted services and reliable data for unique entity identification management
in partnership with the LEI issuing organizations. Our joint efforts have generated great
results. Our data pool nearly doubled in size reaching almost one million LEIs assigned
to entities of global transactions.  
</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<h2>
Our Vision: <br />
One Identity Behind Every Business</h2>
<p>
We believe in the benefits of having only
one identity behind every business.<br />
Having an LEI will help to achieve this objective.
</p>

</div>
<p>
Our services ensure the operational
integrity of the Global LEI System.
We promote the adoption of shared
open data principles, standards and
best practice across sectors around
the world. By doing so, the LEI remains
the industry standard best suited to
providing quality-assured data for
entity identification management.
</p>
<p>
Established by the Financial Stability Board, GLEIF is a not-for-profit organization with a
global mandate to deliver the LEI as a broad public good for any user in the public and
private sector. GLEIF’s international governance framework reinforces the global nature
of its mission.

New research undertaken by McKinsey &amp; Company and GLEIF estimate that broader,
global adoption of LEIs could yield annual savings of over <em>US$ 150 million</em> within the
investment banking industry and up to <em>US$ 500 million</em> for banks in the issuance of
letters of credit. Annual savings in investment banking would include at least 10% of total
operational costs for onboarding clients and trading processing through the use of the LEI.

The white paper identifies three new use cases for LEIs:
capital markets, commercial transactions and the exten-
sion of commercial credit. These are especially relevant
to large corporations, small businesses and their bank-
ing institutions, and investment banks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
Analysis taken as part of this project also indicates that
there are multiple additional use cases beyond the three
identified. Operational efficiencies, cost savings, reduction of time

                        <p>
to transact with clients and more reliable
information can be gained by introducing the LEI into
almost any process that requires identification and verifi-
cation of a counterparty and that has a manual compo-
nent. This resulting easier counterparty identification will
open the door to further automation and digitalization
of financial and commercial transactions across the globe.

The LEI’s primary value is derived from reducing the cost of onboarding clients and of
middle- and back-office activities related to
the processing of stocks, bonds and other
securities trades. All such activities could be
simplified and streamlined if LEI use were
more broadly adopted throughout the lifecycle of the client relationship. The use of the
LEI would also reduce the time spent on data
correction and reconciliation.

                <h3>1. Information on GLEIF</h3>

<p>The accompanying financial statements present the operations of Global Legal Entity
Identifier Foundation with its registered office in Basel, Switzerland (hereinafter: “GLEIF”
or “the Foundation”).</p>
<p>GLEIF is a foundation according to Swiss civil law, and registered under no. CHE-200.595.965
in the commercial register of Basel-Stadt, Switzerland. The address of the Foundation is
St. Alban-Vorstadt 5, 4002 Basel, Switzerland. In February 2015, GLEIF began operating
a permanent establishment in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, where the main operating
activities of the Foundation are located.</p>
<p>GLEIF was founded on June 26, 2014 by the Financial Stability Board, an association under
Swiss law. The purpose of GLEIF is to establish, maintain and monitor the Global Legal
Entity Identifier System (“Global LEI System”) which provides a worldwide unique identification number (the “LEI”) for all parties of financial transactions.</p>
<p>The establishment of this system has been required by the Heads of State and Government of the Group of Twenty, calling the Financial Stability Board to coordinate the work
among the regulatory bodies. Prior to the foundation of GLEIF, the Financial Stability
Board established the Regulatory Oversight Committee (“LEI ROC”) which had set forth
requirements for the structure of the Global LEI System and for the managing, monitoring and standard setting functions, as well as the internal structure and the funding
of the GLEIF. The LEI ROC has, as stipulated in Article 4 of the Statutes, the regulatory
oversight of the Global LEI System, including the activities of GLEIF, in the broad public
interest.</p>
<p>GLEIF is under supervision of the Swiss Supervisory Board of Foundations since the
establishment of the GLEIF in June 2014.</p>
<p>The financial statements have been authorized for publication by the Board of Directors
on March 14, 2018.</p>

                <h3>2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</h3>

                <p>
                These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
                Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board
                (IASB). GLEIF also prepares a set of statutory financial statements in accordance with the
                Swiss Code of Obligations
                </p>
                <p>
                These financial statements are presented in US dollars (US$), with rounding to the nearest
                dollar, unless otherwise stated.
                </p>
                <p>
                The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, unless otherwise stated
                in the accounting policies.
                </p>
                <p>
                The accounting policies set out below are unchanged from the prior period and have
                been applied consistently throughout both periods.

                <h3>2.1 Foreign Currency</h3>
                <p>
                The functional currency of GLEIF is the US dollar, as the Foundation generates its revenues
                and receives almost all cash flows from the LEI issuers (also referred to as Local Operating
                Units (”LOU”)) in this currency.
                </p>
                <p>
                Transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the US dollar are recorded
                at the spot exchange rate at the date when the underlying transactions are initially
                recognized. At the end of the reporting period, foreign currency-denominated monetary
                assets and liabilities are retranslated into US dollars applying the spot exchange rate 
                prevailing at that date. Gains and losses arising from these foreign currency revaluations are
                recognized in income.
                </p>
                <p>
                The exchange rates of the most significant foreign currencies are:

                <h3>2.2 Revenue Recognition</h3>
                <p>
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable net of
discounts and rebates and excluding taxes or duty. Revenue is recognized over the term of
the license period on an accrual basis.
                </p>
                <p>
The revenue of GLEIF is based on arrangements with the LEI issuers to pay to GLEIF a fixed
service fee for each LEI issued and served by the respective issuer.
                </p>
                <p>
The license period of a LEI is one year from the date of issuance or renewal. During this
period, the LEI issuers are responsible to manage and maintain the integrity and accuracy
of the LEI entry data and of the related changes. The services provided by GLEIF to the
LEI issuers relate to quality assurance, standardization, and certain other work with regard
to the LEI issuers’ management of LEIs. Accordingly, the revenue of GLEIF is related to the
service periods of the LEIs. On a straight-line basis, GLEIF recognizes the revenue over the
terms of the contracts between the LEI issuers and the LEI users, and defers the revenue
which is allocated to the portion of the LEI service periods remaining after the balance
sheet date. The outstanding portion of the LEI service periods is estimated based on quarterly performance reports of each LEI issuer.
                </p>
                <p>
The service contracts agreed with the LEI issuers in the past years (“commitment letter”)
set forth a fixed annual service fee for each LEI issued or renewed in the respective calendar year. Quarterly or annual advances are paid by the LEI issuer during the year, and only
the final invoice or credit note is accounted for as a receivable or payable in the balance
sheet. The revenue portion deferred to the next fiscal year from these kind of arrangements is shown as a separate deferral liability.
                </p>
                <p>
During 2017, the new “master agreement” arrangement has been set forth for the majority
of LEI issuers. Under this contract, the LEI issuer pays a quarterly service fee based on all
active LEIs under its management at the end of the quarter. According to the revenue
recognition assumptions described above, 50% of the service fee charged at the end of
each quarter is not recognized until the subsequent quarter. For service fees under this
new agreement, GLEIF only reflects in the balance sheet the 50% portion of the quarterly
service fee relating to the services recognized for the ending quarter as revenue during the
period, the remaining 50% that has neither been earned nor billed at quarter end is not
shown in the balance sheet and only recognized in the subsequent quarter.
                </p>
                <h3>2.3 Government Grants</h3>
                <p>
A government grant or assistance is recognized only when there is reasonable assurance
that GLEIF will comply with any conditions attached to the grant and the grant will be
received. The grant is recognized as income over the period necessary to match with
the related costs, for which they are intended to compensate, on a systematic basis. A
grant receivable as compensation for costs already incurred or for immediate financial
support, with no future related costs, is recognized as income in the period in which it is
receivable. A grant relating to assets (capitalized expenditure) is recognized as deferred
income (liability), and released in accordance with the amortization of the related assets.

                <h3>2.2 Revenue Recognition</h3>
                <p>
Interest income and expense are recognized using the effective interest method. The
effective interest rate is established on initial recognition of the financial asset or liability
and is not revised subsequently.
                </p>
                <h3>2.5 Income Taxes</h3>
                <p>
Since 2015, the Foundation’s activities are located in Basel, Switzerland, and in Frankfurt
am Main, Germany. GLEIF is free from Swiss income taxes based on an assessment of the

monitor the Global LEI System are free from corporate and trade tax on income by law.

                <h3>2.6 Provisions</h3>
                <p>
A provision is recognized in the balance sheet when the Foundation has a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made
of the amount of the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are recognized at present value by discounting the expected future cash flows at a rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money. When a contract becomes onerous, the
present obligation under the contract is recognized as a provision and measured at the
lower of the expected cost of fulfilling the contract and the expected cost of terminating the contract as far as they exceed the expected economic benefits of the contract.
Additions to provisions and reversals are generally recognized in the income statements. 
                </p>
                <p>
Provisions for pension obligations are recognized by using the projected unit credit
method, based on reasonable assumptions for the long-term expected rate of salary
increases and benefit increases, demographic assumptions and long-term interest rates
as of the balance sheet date. The related plan assets are recognized at their fair value, in
accordance with IAS 19.
                </p>
                <h3>2.7 Lease Commitments</h3>
                <p>
A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards
incidental to ownership. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
                </p>
                <h4>Finance Leases</h4>
                <p>
GLEIF recognizes assets held under finance leases at the fair value at the inception of the
lease or if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The related liability
to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments
are apportioned between interest expenses and capital redemption of the liability.
                </p>
                <p>
Contingent rentals are recognized as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.
                </p>

                <h4>Operating Leases</h4>
                <p>
GLEIF recognizes operating lease payments as an expense on a straight-line basis over the
lease term. Contingent rentals arising under operating leases are recognized in the period
in which they are incurred. Lease incentives and similar arrangements of incentives are
taken into account when calculating the straightlined expense.
                </p>

                <h3>2.8 Tangible Fixed Assets</h3>
                <p>
GLEIF items of tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost. Cost
includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of each
item. Tangible fixed assets are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Depreciation is charged to
allocate the cost of assets less their residual values over their estimated
useful lives, using the straight-line method.
                </p>
                <p>
The estimated useful lives of all items of tangible fixed assets are as follows:
                </p>

                <p>
                Separately acquired items of intangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost. Cost
                includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of each item. After
                initial measurement, intangible fixed assets are measured at cost less accumulated
                amortization and any accumulated impairment losses. Amortization is charged on a
                straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible fixed assets.
                </p>
                <p>
                The estimated useful lives of intangible assets are as follows: 
                </p>

                <p>
                As at the end of the current fiscal year, GLEIF did not have intangible assets with an indefinite useful life.
                </p>
                <h3>2.10 Financial Instruments</h3>
                <p>
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a
financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial assets of the Foundation
mainly include cash and cash equivalents, long- and short-term security deposits and
receivables from LEI issuers’ fees. Financial liabilities of the Foundation mainly comprise
payables to vendors, and to employees and Board Directors. GLEIF does not make use of
the option to designate financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit
or loss at inception (Fair Value Option). Based on their nature, financial instruments are
classified as financial assets and financial liabilities measured at cost or amortized cost and
financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value.
                </p>
                <p>
Financial instruments are recognized on the balance sheet when GLEIF becomes a party to
the contractual obligations of the instrument. Regular way purchases or sales of financial
assets, i.e. purchases or sales under a contract whose terms require delivery of the asset
within the time frame established generally by regulation or convention in the marketplace
concerned, are accounted for at the trade date.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="twopage">
            <div class="page narrow notes">
                <div class="page-header">
                    <div class="title" >Annual Report 2017 |</div>
                </div>
                <p>
Initially, financial instruments are recognized at their fair value.
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of
financial instruments are only included in determining the carrying amount, if
the financial instruments are not measured at fair value through profit or
loss. Subsequently, financial assets and liabilities are measured according to
the category – cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets,
loans and receivables, financial liabilities measured at amortized cost – to
which they are assigned. 
                </p>
                <p>
<b>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</b> The Foundation considers all highly liquid investments that
are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant
risk of change in value and have less than three months maturity from the date of acquisition
to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are measured at cost.
                </p>
                <p>
<b>Loans and Receivables:</b> Financial assets classified as loans and receivables are measured
at amortized cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses. Impairment losses on trade and other receivables are recognized using separate allowance
accounts.
                </p>
                <p>
<b>Financial Liabilities:</b> The Foundation measures financial liabilities at amortized cost using
the effective interest method.
                </p>
                <h3>2.11 Accounting Pronouncements Applied in the Financial Statements</h3>
                <p>
GLEIF has applied all IFRS accounting pronouncements which are effective for this reporting period. The Foundation has not adopted standards already issued but not yet effective
for this reporting period.
                </p>
                <h3>2.12 Not Yet Adopted Recent Accounting Pronouncements</h3>
                <p>
The following pronouncements issued by the IASB are not yet effective and have not yet
been adopted by the Foundation:
                </p>
                <p>
In July 2014, the IASB published the final version of IFRS 9: Financial Instruments. The new
standard will replace IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9
introduces a single approach for the classification and measurement of financial assets
according to their cash flow characteristics and the business model they are managed in,
and provides a new impairment model based on expected credit losses. IFRS 9 also includes
new regulations regarding the application of hedge accounting to better reflect an entity’s
risk management activities especially with regard to managing non-financial risks. The
new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1,
2018, while early application is permitted. The classification and measurement of financial
instruments under the new standard will not have a material impact on the Foundation’s
financial statements.
                </p>
                <p>
In May 2014, the IASB issued IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
According to the new standard, revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of
promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the Foundation expects to be entitled in exchange for
those goods or services. Revenue is recognized when, or as, the customer
obtains control of the goods or services. IFRS 15 also includes
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="page narrow notes">
                <div class="page-header">

                </div>
                <p>
guidance on the presentation of contract balances, that is assets and
liabilities arising from contracts with customers, depending on the
relationship between the entity’s performance and the customer’s payment. In
addition, the new standard requires a set of quantitative and qualitative
disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to understand the
nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from
contracts with customers. IFRS 15 supersedes IAS 11: Construction Contracts and
IAS 18: Revenue as well as related interpretations. The standard is effective
for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018; early application is
permitted. Based on the current revenue structure of GLEIF, the Foundation
assesses that the adoption of IFRS 15 will not have a material impact on the
financial statements.
                </p>
                <p>
In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16, Leases. It supersedes IAS 17 and related interpre-
tations. The new standard eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases
or finance leases as is required by IAS 17 and, instead, introduces a single lessee account-
ing model. Applying that model, a lessee is required to recognize assets and liabilities for
all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value;
and depreciation of lease assets separately from interest on lease liabilities in the income
statement. The new stand will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after
January 1, 2019. Early application is permitted, when IFRS 15 is also applied. Based on the
current lease contracts which are mainly classified as operating lease in accordance with
IAS 17, the Foundation assesses that the adoption will cause a material increase of assets
and related lease liabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
GLEIF does not plan to adopt any new pronouncement prior to the regular effective date.
                </p>
                <h3>2.13 Critical Accounting Estimates</h3>
                <p>
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB.
The significant accounting policies, as described above and in this section, are essential
to understanding the Foundation’s results of operations, financial positions, and cash
flows. Certain of these accounting policies require critical accounting estimates that
involve complex and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions, some of which
may be for matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change. Such critical
accounting estimates may have a material impact on the results of operations, financial
positions and cash flows.
                </p>
                <p>
<b>Revenue Recognition on Service Contracts:</b> The allocation of revenue relating to the
Foundation’s service contracts with LEI issuers to the appropriate accounting periods
is based on reasonable estimates of the timing of the underlying LEI service contracts
between the LEI issuers and the LEI users. The Foundation receives quarterly reports
from the LEI issuers detailing the number of LEIs renewed or newly issued by the LEI
issuers. GLEIF has applied estimates, assuming that the issuance and the renewal of
each LEI, and the related start of a standard one-year service period, is distributed on a
straight-line basis within the reported quarters. Changes in these estimates may lead to
an increase or decrease of revenue.

While a significant portion of the overall GLEIF fees are from LEI issuers with a legal seat
in Europe, the underlying cash flows of the GLEIF are generated by a very geographically
diverse population of LEI registrants. As a result, the GLEIF does not have a material con-
centration of its cash flows given the location of LEI registrants.

                <h4>Pension Plan</h4>
                <p>
                Under Swiss law, GLEIF has to arrange for an affiliation contract with a pension fund for the
Swiss employees to comply with legal requirements. The pension fund has to provide at
least occupational benefits according to law.
                </p>
                <p>
                In 2015 GLEIF set up a pension plan in Switzerland with AXA
Vorsorgestiftung, as a collective foundation. Based on the plan rules and
pension law in Switzerland the plan qualifies as a defined benefit scheme under
IFRS. The insurance plan is contribution-based. The plan contains a cash
balance benefit formula. Under Swiss law, the pension fund guarantees the
vested benefit amount as confirmed anually to members.
                </p>
                <p>
The collective foundation of AXA guarantees a 40% coverage of the retirement accounts
covered by an insurance. The other assets are pooled for all affiliated companies. The
collective foundation can adjust risk and cost contributions according to the circumstances.
The employer has to cover at least half of all contributions. The collective foundation is
able to withdraw from the contract with the employer. In that case, the company needs to
affiliate with another pension institution.
                </p>
                <p>
GLEIF recognized pension cost of US$ 34,071 (2016: US$ 35,841) within personnel expenses
and net interest expenses of US$ 374 (2016: US$ 198), and paid employer and employee
contributions of US$ 8,385 (2016: US$ 15,149) to the scheme.
                </p>
                <p>
Actuarial gains of US$ 53,432 (2016: US$ 1,461) from the defined benefit obligation, net of
US$ 9,006 losses (2016: US$ 6,548) from the return on plan assets have been recognized as
other comprehensive income.
                </p>
                <p>
The defined benefit obligation amounts to US$ 47,124 at December 31, 2017 (December 31,
2016: US$ 75,876), net of the plan assets of US$ 24,753 (December 31, 2016: US$ 36,627).
A net pension liability of 
US$ {{monetary ifrs:NoncurrentRecognisedLiabilitiesDefinedBenefitPlan[period-type=instant] }}22,371{{ end }} 
(December 31, 2016: US$ {{ monetary ifrs:NoncurrentRecognisedLiabilitiesDefinedBenefitPlan[period=prev, period-type=instant] }}39,249{{ end }}) has been recognized
in the balance sheet as at December 31, 2017.
                </p>
                <p>
The weighted average duration of the obligation is 18.8 (2016: 18.9) years. The employee
and employer contributions expected for the next fiscal year are US$ 6,703 each.
                </p>
                <p>
For the calculation of the defined benefit obligation a discount rate of 0.7% (2016: 0.7%)
and a long-term salary increase rate of 1.0% (2016: 1.0%) is used. Mortality, risk of disability,
and turnover rates are set in accordance with the statistical database BVG 2015.
                </p>
                <p>
For the most important parameters which influence the pension obligation of the employer
a sensitivity analysis has been performed. The discount rate and the assumption for salary

changing the mortality with a constant factor for all age groups, resulting in a change of
the longevity for the ages by one year longer or shorter as the baseline value. The sensitivity
analysis results are as follows:
