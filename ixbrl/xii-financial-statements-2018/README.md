## Features

On larger screens, the stylesheet recreates the pagination that is familiar in PDF financial reports.  On smaller screens, the sample uses responsive CSS to reformat the document for improved readability.

The stylesheet also include print-specific CSS to map the pagination shown on screen to physical pages.  Using "Print to PDF" in the Chrome will create a quality PDF version of the report.  Wherever possible, Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) have been used to avoid the lower quality resulting from scaling bitmap images in print format.

It's worth noting that the signed, audited PDF document that can be found on the XBRL International website was produced from the iXBRL, not the other way around.
