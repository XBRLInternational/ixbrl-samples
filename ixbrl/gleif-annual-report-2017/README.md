## Report package

The [report package](rp) combines the iXBRL document, the supporting CSS, image and font assets, and the XBRL extension taxonomy into a single package, following the guidance set out in the Report Packages Working Group Note published by [XBRL International](xii).

## Features

Where screen space allows, the iXBRL recreates the A3 landscape formatting of
the original PDF, switching to portrait A4 formatting on narrower screens.

The stylesheet includes print-specific formatting which removes the pagination
effect so that the document is formatted onto real pages.
